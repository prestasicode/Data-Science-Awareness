Confidence helps us feel ready for life's experiences. When we're confident, we're more likely to move forward with people and opportunities — not back away from them. And if things don't work out at first, confidence helps us try again.

Learning how to be confident is important in every part of your life, but there are some instances where it’s crucial – especially at times where you feel like giving up.

Knowing how to be confident in yourself is important beyond the workplace, too. Learning how to be more confident can help you attract a partner you can build a healthy relationship with. It can also help you effectively handle conflict and seek out new opportunities ­that will foster your personal growth.

If you want to learn how to build confidence, you must be willing to change your state. Your state is essentially your mood at any given time of day. Your mood is influenced by how you feel about yourself at that point in time. The good news is you can change your state at any time – no matter what’s going on around you – as long as you know how to do it.

You must change your perspective and your mindset, and choose to be confident. And part of achieving this is believing – building certainty – that you are confident.

Learn how to recognize your need for control and take steps toward letting go. Find a true sense of contentment and build confidence in your life.
