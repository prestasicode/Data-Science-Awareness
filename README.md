# Data Science Awareness

Data science is not about:
1. Using the latest tools
2. Plotting the best graphs
3. Building the best ML model
4. Having the fancy title "Data Scientist"

Data science is about:
1. Understanding the business problem
2. Being curious to understand the data
3. Getting insights from data to solve the problem
4. Convincing stakeholders to take action

Remember,
You're a problem solver, Get the foundation right. ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
