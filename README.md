# Data Science Awareness

Data science is not about:
â€¢ Using the latest tools
â€¢ Plotting the best graphs
â€¢ Building the best ML model
â€¢ Having the fancy title "Data Scientist"

Data science is about:
â€¢ Understanding the business problem
â€¢ Being curious to understand the data
â€¢ Getting insights from data to solve the problem
â€¢ Convincing stakeholders to take action

Remember,
You're a problem solver, Get the foundation right. ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
